# Spend more time shipping and less time stuck on bottlenecks

Experience your application from the customer’s point of view. Your team can find broken code, see where slow load times occur, and get notified when an error is detected or a page crashes – all from within one tool.

Don’t wait for your users to be impacted.
PHP Profiler is built to avoid firefighting.
Analyze your application performance anywhere it is deployed (hint: the earlier, the better):

On development machines, unlock quicker experimentations and iterations
In any testing pipeline and staging, make sure that feature additions don’t introduce any performance regressions
In production, with fine-grained insights and alerting policies, catch any abnormal behaviors.
