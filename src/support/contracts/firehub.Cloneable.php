 * ### Cloneable contract
 *
 * Creating a copy of an object with fully replicated properties is not always the wanted behavior.
 * An object copy is created by using the clone keyword (which calls the object's __clone() method if possible).
 * When an object is cloned, PHP will perform a shallow copy of all the object's properties. Any properties that
 * are references to other variables will remain references.
 * @since 1.0.0
